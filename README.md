Upload.php will help to provide a webpage to upload a csv file.


import_csv.php
Rename the dataset DS7E csv file with "DS7E.csv" name.
Store that csv file in the same folder with php files.
As I(Urvesh) am using wamp servre, I have kept a copy of the file at this location: C:/wamp64/tmp/DS7E.csv. It is required to get the path to import the data of the file.
Replace "localhost", "username", "password", and "database" with your MySQL server details. 
In this file: localhost:"localhost", username:"root", password:"" and database:"fitness".
